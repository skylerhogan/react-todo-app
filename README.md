This is my first attempt at a todo app using React.

## Current State

It uses React hooks, useEffect, useState, and useRef. At this point you will be able to add, remove, edit, and mark complete/cross out the todo items.

## Future Implementation

Next I would like to make the list persistent across devices using a database like MongoDB.
